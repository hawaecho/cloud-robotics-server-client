	Abstract = {In the communication network pricing literature, it is the linear pricing schemes that have been largely adopted as the means of controlling network usage or generating profits for network service providers. This paper extends the framework to nonlinear pricing and investigates optimal nonlinear pricing policy design for a monopolistic service provider. The problem is formulated as an incentive-design problem, and incentive (pricing) policies are obtained for a many-users regime, which enable the service provider to approach arbitrarily close to Pareto- optimal solutions. Under the assumption that the service provider knows the true user types, analytical and numerical results indicate a profit improvement exceeding 38% over linear pricing by the introduction of nonlinear pricing. We also consider the scenario where the service provider has incomplete information on user types. A comparative study of the results for complete information and incomplete information is carried out as well, with numerical results pointing to 25%-40% loss of profit by the service provider due to incompleteness of information on the user types.},

	Abstract = { Presents a probabilistic algorithm for simultaneously estimating the pose of a mobile robot and the positions of nearby people in a previously mapped environment. This approach, called the conditional particle filter, tracks a large distribution of person locations conditioned upon a smaller distribution of robot poses over time. This method is robust to sensor noise, occlusion, and uncertainty in robot localization. In fact, conditional particle filters can accurately track people in situations with global uncertainty over robot pose. The number of samples required by this filter scales linearly with the number of people being tracked, making the algorithm feasible to implement in real-time in environments with large numbers of people. Experimental results illustrate the accuracy of tracking and model selection, as well as the performance of an active following behavior based on this algorithm.},

@article{sonar,
	Abstract = {The application of the extended Kaman filter to the problem of mobile robot navigation in a known environment is presented. An algorithm for, model-based localization that relies on the concept of a geometric beacon, a naturally occurring environment feature that can be reliably observed in successive sensor measurements and can be accurately described in terms of a concise geometric parameterization, is developed. The algorithm is based on an extended Kalman filter that utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and an a priori map of beacon locations. Two implementations of this navigation algorithm, both of which use sonar, are described. The first implementation uses a simple vehicle with point kinematics equipped with a single rotating sonar. The second implementation uses a `Robuter' mobile robot and six static sonar transducers to provide localization information while the vehicle moves at typical speeds of 30 cm/s},
